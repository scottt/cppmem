(** Sets over ordered types.

  This module implements the set data structure, given a total ordering
  function over the set elements. All operations over sets
  are purely applicative (no side-effects).
  The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and is therefore
  reasonably efficient: insertion and membership take time
  logarithmic in the size of the set, for instance.

type 'a set
(** The type of sets. *)

val empty: ('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a set
(** The empty set. *)

val is_empty: 'a set -> bool
(** Test whether a set is empty or not. *)

val from_list: ('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a list -> 'a set

val mem: 'a -> 'a set -> bool
(** [mem x s] tests whether [x] belongs to the set [s]. *)

val add: 'a -> 'a set -> 'a set
(** [add x s] returns a set containing all elements of [s],
  plus [x]. If [x] was already in [s], [s] is returned unchanged. *)

val singleton: ('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a -> 'a set
(** [singleton x] returns the one-element set containing only [x]. *)

val remove: 'a -> 'a set -> 'a set
(** [remove x s] returns a set containing all elements of [s],
  except [x]. If [x] was not in [s], [s] is returned unchanged. *)

val union: 'a set -> 'a set -> 'a set
(** Set union. *)

val inter: 'a set -> 'a set -> 'a set
(** Set intersection. *)

(** Set difference. *)
val diff: 'a set -> 'a set -> 'a set

val compare: 'a set -> 'a set -> int
(** Total ordering between sets. Can be used as the ordering function
  for doing sets of sets. *)

val equal: 'a set -> 'a set -> bool
(** [equal s1 s2] tests whether the sets [s1] and [s2] are
  equal, that is, contain equal elements. *)

val subset: 'a set -> 'a set -> bool
(** [subset s1 s2] tests whether the set [s1] is a subset of
  the set [s2]. *)

val iter: ('a -> unit) -> 'a set -> unit
(** [iter f s] applies [f] in turn to all elements of [s].
  The elements of [s] are presented to [f] in increasing order
  with respect to the ordering over the type of the elements. *)

val fold: ('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a set -> 'b -> 'b
(** [fold f s a] computes [(f xN ... (f x2 (f x1 a))...)],
  where [x1 ... xN] are the elements of [s], in increasing order. *)

val map: ('b -> 'b -> int) -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a set -> 'b set

val for_all: ('a -> bool) -> 'a set -> bool
(** [for_all p s] checks if all elements of the set
  satisfy the predicate [p]. *)

val exists: ('a -> bool) -> 'a set -> bool
(** [exists p s] checks if at least one element of
  the set satisfies the predicate [p]. *)

val filter: ('a -> bool) -> 'a set -> 'a set
(** [filter p s] returns the set of all elements in [s]
  that satisfy predicate [p]. *)

val partition: ('a -> bool) -> 'a set -> 'a set * 'a set
(** [partition p s] returns a pair of sets [(s1, s2)], where
  [s1] is the set of all the elements of [s] that satisfy the
  predicate [p], and [s2] is the set of all the elements of
  [s] that do not satisfy [p]. *)

val cardinal: 'a set -> int
(** Return the number of elements of a set. *)

val elements: 'a set -> 'a list
(** Return the list of all elements of the given set.
  The returned list is sorted in increasing order with respect
  to the ordering [Ord.compare], where [Ord] is the argument
  given to {!Set.Make}. *)

val min_elt: 'a set -> 'a
(** Return the smallest element of the given set
  (with respect to the [Ord.compare] ordering), or raise
  [Not_found] if the set is empty. *)

val max_elt: 'a set -> 'a
(** Same as {!Set.S.min_elt}, but returns the largest element of the
  given set. *)

val choose: 'a set -> 'a
(** Return one element of the given set, or raise [Not_found] if
  the set is empty. Which element is chosen is unspecified,
  but equal elements will be chosen for equal sets. *)

val split: 'a -> 'a set -> 'a set * bool * 'a set
    (** [split x s] returns a triple [(l, present, r)], where
      [l] is the set of elements of [s] that are
      strictly less than [x];
      [r] is the set of elements of [s] that are
      strictly greater than [x];
      [present] is [false] if [s] contains no element equal to [x],
      or [true] if [s] contains an element equal to [x]. *)
