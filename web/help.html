    <h2>CppMem: an interactive C/C++ memory model explorer</h2>
    <p>CppMem is a tool to let one explore the behaviour of small concurrent test programs in the 
relaxed memory model of the recent C11 and C++11
revisions  of C and C++
[<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3376.pdf">C++11 public draft N3376 (see 1.10, 29, 30)</a>],
[<a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/wg14/">WG14</a>] [<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/">WG21</a>], 
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2008/HPL-2008-56.html">Boehm
  and Adve, PLDI 2008</a>],  as formalised by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cpp/">Batty et al. [POPL 2011]</a>, which explains the model.
 </p>



<h3>Usage</h3> 
<p>
To start CppMem, simply <a href="index.html">click here</a>.  The
basic usage is to select a model variant and test program, in the top
left, and click <b>run</b>.  The tool then computes the set of all
candidate executions of that program, and whether each of them is
consistent and race-free according to the model.  You can then inspect
the candidate executions one by one: for the current candidate, the
tool shows its events and relations graphically in the bottom right,
and shows the values of the model predicates for it in the top right.
The <b>next candidate</b> and <b>previous candidate</b> buttons show
the next or previous candidate, while the <b>next consistent</b>
and <b>previous consistent</b> buttons skip to the next or previous
consistent candidate.  To change the program or model variant, one
has to first click <b>reset</b>.  To bring up this page, click <b>help</b>.
</p><p>
In the bottom left, the <b>Display Relations</b>, <b>Display Layout</b>, and <b>edit display options</b> let one fine-tune the graphical display.  

Clicking on the model predicates in the top right brings up another tab or window with their <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~so294/lem/">Lem</a> definitions.  Individual predicates can be ignored by clicking on the attached tick boxes, changing the behaviour of the <b>next consistent</b> and <b>previous consistent</b> buttons.

The current execution can be exported in various formats with the 
<b>Files: out.exc</b>, <b>out.dot</b>, <b>out.dsp</b>, or <b>out.tex</b> links. 
</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>
CppMem supports the following versions of the C/C++11 model. 
<ul> 
<li><a href="cmm.html#standard"><b>standard</b></a> 
This is the memory model described by the 2011 C++11 standard. The
mathematical definitions were constructed in discussion with the
standardisation comittee, and there is a close correspondence between
them and the standard text.
This is essentially the same as the model described in our 
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cpp/">POPL 2011 paper</a>, but
with some light refactoring and improved lock and RMW semantics, as in
our <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cppppc-supplemental/pldi010-sarkar.pdf">PLDI 2012 paper</a>.

</li>
<li><a href="cmm.html#preferred"><b>preferred</b></a> (or no_vsse).
This is a simplified variant of the standard
model, that should be equivalent to it. 
It removes the complicated notion of visible sequences of side effects
  (VSSEs), whose force is
covered by the coherence requirements.  For those looking to work with
general C or C++ concurrency, this is the preferred model.
</li>
<!--<li><a href="cmm.html#separate_lo"><b>separate_lo</b></a>
This is a variant of the preferred model with a separate lock --
  --order.</li>
-->
<!-- <li><a href="cmm.html#multi_lo"><b>multi_lo</b></a>
This is another equivalent model uses per-location lock orders rather
     than a shared one. </li>
-->
<li><a href="cmm.html#tot"><b>tot</b></a>
This is a simpler model, for programs without consumes, relaxed,
  acquires or releases, that should be equivalent to the others for
  those. It has a single total order over all memory accesses.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Program</h3>
<p>
Test programs can be selected from a drop-down menu or typed directly into the window.  
They can be written in a small fragment of C/C++ including some of the C11/C++11 concurrency primitives.  It also supports three non-standard extensions for writing concise tests: a parallel composition, written <code>{{{ ... ||| ... }}}</code>;  constraints on read values such as <code>x.readsvalue(1)</code>, which restricts attention to candidate executions in which that read of <code>x</code> reads the value <code>1</code>; and
dummy "thread-local" targets for reads, 
where we suppress the normal write events for variables starting with "r", e.g. in <code>r1=x</code> or  <code>r2=x.load(memory_order_relaxed)</code>.
The tool calculates the set of <em>all</em> possible candidate executions for the test program, 
so tests should be relatively small and terminating. For some examples the interface will be unresponsive while it computes.
</p>
<p>
Instead of a program, one can also enter an execution (an <code>.exc</code> file), which directly specifies the actions and relations of some candidate execution of interest.
</p>


<h3>Display</h3>
<h4>Display Relations</h4>
<p> 
The models use various binary relations over memory read, write, read-modify-write, lock, unlock, and fence actions.  
Clicking on these check boxes determines whether they are displayed in the graph, but does not affect the model. 
The first relations are determined by a choice of control-flow path for each thread, and the tool enumerates all possible alternatives using a thread-local semantics for the fragment of C/C++ supported.
<ul>
<li> <b>sb</b>   sequenced-before relation</li>
<li> <b>asw</b>  additional-synchronises-with  </li>
<li> <b>dd</b>   data-dependency  </li>
<li> <b>cd</b>   control-dependency </li>
</ul>
Next we have several relations that are existentially quantified: for each choice of control-flow paths, the tool enumerates all possible alternatives of the following: 
<ul>
<li> <b>rf</b> The reads-from relation, from writes to all the reads that read from them </li>
<li> <b>tot</b>  The total order of the <code>tot</code> model </li>
<li> <b>mo</b>  The modification order (or coherence order) over writes to atomic locations, total per location </li>
<li> <b>sc</b>  A total order over the sequentially consistent atomic actions </li>
<li> <b>lo</b>  The lock order </li>
</ul>
Finally there are derived relations, calculated by the model from the relations above:
<ul>
<li> <b>hb</b>  happens-before </li>
<li> <b>vse</b>  visible side effects </li>
<li> <b>vsses</b>  visible sequences of side effects </li>
<li> <b>ithb</b>  inter-thread happens-before </li>
<li> <b>dob</b>  dependency-ordered-before </li>
<li> <b>cad</b>  carries-a-dependency-to </li>
<li> <b>sw</b>  synchronises-with </li>
<li> <b>hrs</b>  hypothetical release sequence </li>
<li> <b>rs</b>  release sequence </li>
<li> <b>data_races</b>  inter-thread data races </li>
<li> <b>unsequenced_races</b> intra-thread unsequenced races, unrelated by sb  </li>
</ul>

</p>
<h4>Display Layout</h4>
<p>
There are several graph layout choices available: <b>dot</b>, <b>neato_par</b>, <b>neato_par_init</b>, and <b>neato_downwards</b>.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to output the graph with tex labels. 
</p>
<h4>Display Options</h4>
<p>
This lets one tune a variety of other display parameters, for font size, etc.

<h3>About</h3>
CppMem exists in web-interface and command-line versions.
It is written in OCaml; the web-interface version uses js_of_ocaml to compile into JavaScript, with most of the computation running in the browser but graph layout on a server.  The model definitions are written in <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~so294/lem/">Lem</a> and compiled from that to OCaml code.
